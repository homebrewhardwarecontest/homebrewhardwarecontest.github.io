	<h2>What is the Homebrew Hardware Contest?</h2>
	<p><pre>The HomebrewHardware contest is being held in SAFE MODE for DC28.  It's a place to showcase the skills abd techniques you've learned, 
and projects you made since DC27.

SAFE MODE Rules:
1.  Submit an email writeup using the form below, telling us what you made and proof of how you made it.  Include video, pictures, blogs.
2.  As we are remote, be as descriptive as possible, and include lots of visual content.
3.  A panel of judges will elminate entries, down to a 'top' group based on a number of attributes including:
innovativeness, construction techniques, utility, aesthetics, and bribes.
4.  Prizes will be awarded for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place.  Judges Favorites will also be awarded.
5.  Entries can be teams or individuals.
6.  Entries can leverage commercial parts and gear, but should strive to meet the spirit of Homebrew.
7.  Entries should be new, i.e. not entered last year, and created mostly between DC27 and DC28.
8.  If the technology works out, judging for 1st, 2nd and 3rd place will happen live via twitch or a similar service.
9.  The <a href="https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-28/dc-28-index.html">theme</a> of DC 28 is "Discovery".  The entry that best embodies this will be
given a special award.
