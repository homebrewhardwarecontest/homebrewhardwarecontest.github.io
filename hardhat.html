	<h2>Some Useful Information</h2>
	<p>The best hats often use cheap materials - A Type 1 hardhat is $16.00 USD at HomeDespot for example.
		<p></p>
		Hard hats are  designed for safety. As such, most of them are made from a material that paint does not adhere to (including some adhesives/epoxies), at least without some real effort.
		<p></p>
		The plastic in many hard hats is pretty soft, using a punch to dimple where you may be drilling is helpful to keep a drill lined up. And help avoid injury.
		<p></p>
		Hard hats can be HOT.  Do some test runs wearing it before venturing into the Las Vegas heat. 
		<P></P>
		LiPo batteries can catch on fire!  Use at your own risk. (Do we need to say anything else about that?)
		<p></p>
Consider power and weight concerns - we are looking for entries that can be worn ALL DAY.
